#### Trivia
---
<i>laxism</i>: a viewpoint in the probabilistic controversy that in a conflict between liberty and law a slightly probable argument for liberty suffices to furnish a basis for action

<i>probabilism</i>: a theory that certainty is impossible especially in the sciences and that probability suffices to govern belief and action

#### Philosopher's beans
<i>Few beans of this handful are white <br/>
  Most beans in this bag are white <br/>
  Therefore, probably these beans were taken from another bag <br/>
  This is an hypothetical inference!</i>
